# HeaderSniffer

Analyze and inspect incoming HTTP headers and client IP addresses with ease. HeaderSniffer is your go-to web utility for debugging and understanding HTTP requests. Ideal for developers, QA engineers, and network administrators.

## TODO

### HTTPS
Since you're dealing with HTTP headers, you should ensure that the service runs over HTTPS to secure the data in transit. You can get free SSL/TLS certificates from services like Let's Encrypt.

### Hosting
You can host your Golang service on a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Alternatively, you can use a simpler platform like Heroku, which supports Golang and makes it easy to deploy web apps.

### Load Balancing
If you expect high traffic, consider setting up a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of your service.

### Monitoring and Logging
Implement some form of logging and monitoring to keep an eye on the performance and availability of your service. You can use tools like Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for dashboard visualization.

### Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your service. The simplest form of rate limiting for a Golang HTTP service can be implemented using a middleware.

### Finalize Code
Before you deploy, make sure your code is production-ready. This might include tasks like adding proper error handling, setting timeouts, etc.

### Testing
Perform thorough testing to make sure your service works as expected. This could be unit tests, integration tests, or even manual tests.

After taking these steps, you should have a tool that is publicly accessible and ready for use!
